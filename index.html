  <meta name="description" content="RTD is a app to help you figure out rate of thyroid decline which is main cause of plateau during weight control https://zendoclab.github.io/rtd Interpretation of RTD If RTD value is 100%, it means that rate of thyroid decline due to weight loss is similar to comparison standards. If it exceeds more than 120% and rises faster over time, it means that decline of thyroid gland is faster than weight loss and plateau may become more severe. If you are at a plateau during weight loss and RTD is high, utilize Advice below to overcome plateau and maintain your RTD at around 100%. RTD value is calculated based on the user’s BMI (height, weight), resting heart rate (change in thyroid function according to body mass), and comparison standard (statistical value). If you have cardiovascular, hormonal-related diseases such as thyroid or diabetes, or mental-related diseases such as anxiety disorders, the correlation between heart rate and thyroid function and body weight and thyroid function may decrease, so be careful when interpreting and using RTD values. Advice for plateau during weight control Don’t ‘not eating’: If you starve, your leptin level will drop, causing your thyroid to decline further, you get more nervous, and coping with stress become more difficult, resulting in a vicious cycle. Be generous and Sleep well: Weight control is a restructuring of your body and an emergency situation. If you fail to cope with stress, your T3(active component of thyroid hormone) will drop further, causing a more severe plateau. Exercise: Don’t obsess over calories, but move more as a coping with stress and cognitive behavioral correction. Instructions After entering first data, enter second data a few days or 1-2 weeks later depending on weight loss. Entered data and graphs are permanently stored only on your device (smartphone, PC) (can be changed or deleted) and are not connected to external databases, etc. RTD value is calculated starting from second data entry. This webpage provides interpretation and advice on RTD values." />
